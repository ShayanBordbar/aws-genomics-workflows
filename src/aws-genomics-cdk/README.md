# Genomics Workflows on AWS - CDK code

Contained herein is a CDK application for creating AWS resources for working 
with large-scale biomedical data - e.g. genomics.  

In order to deploy this CDK application, you'll need an environment with AWS 
CLI access and AWS CDK installed. A quick way to get an environment for running 
this application is to launch [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/).  

AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets 
you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a code 
editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes prepackaged with essential 
tools for popular programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, PHP, and 
more, so you donâ€™t need to install files or configure your development machine 
to start new projects.


## Download

Clone the repo to your local environment / Cloud9 environment.
```
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-genomics-workflows.git
```

## Configure

This CDK application requires an S3 bucket and a VPC. The application can 
create them as part of the deployment or you could configure the application to 
use your own S3 bucket and/or existing VPC.

After cloning the repo, open, update, and save the application configuration 
file - `app.config.json`.

**accountID** - Your 
[AWS account id](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/console_account-alias.html).  
**region** - The 
[AWS region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html) 
you want to use for the deployment (e.g., us-east-1, us-west-2, etc.).  
**projectName** - A name for the project that will be used as a prefix for the 
CDK stacks and constrcuts.  
**tags** - A list of key,value strings to use as tags for the AWS resources 
created by this app.  
**S3.existingBucket** - If you want to use an existing bucket, set this value 
to true, otherwise set it to false to create a new bucket.  
**S3.bucketName** - The bucket name to use or create.  
**VPC.createVPC** - If you want to create a new VPC, set this to true, 
otherwise set to false.  
**VPC.VPCName** - The VPC name to use a create.  
**VPC.maxAZs** - The amount of availability zones to use when creating a new 
VPC.  
**VPC.cidr** - The 
[CIDR block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) for 
the new VPC.  
**VPC.cidrMask** - The 
[CIDR block subnet mask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#Subnet_masks) 
for the new VPC.  
**batch.defaultVolumeSize** - The default EBS volume size in GiB to be attached 
to the EC2 instance under AWS Batch.  
**batch.spotMaxVCPUs** - The limit on vcpus when using 
[spot instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/).  
**batch.onDemendMaxVCPUs** - The limit on vcpus when using on-demand instances.  
**batch.instanceTypes** - The 
[EC2 instance types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) to use in 
AWS Batch.  
**workflows** - A list of workflows that you would like to launch. There are 
demo workflows under the `lib/workflows` directory. To add a workflow, update 
the code in the `lib/aws-genomics-cdk-stack.ts` file. Look for the workflows 
section.

## Deploy

To deploy the CDK application, use the command line and make sure you are in 
the root folder of the CDK application (`src/aws-genomics-cdk`).  
First install the neccessary node.js modules
```
npm install
```

Then deploy the application.
```
# The "--require-approval never" parameter will skip the question to approve 
# specific resouce creation, such as IAM roles. You can remove this parameter 
# if you want to be prompted to approve creating these resources.
cdk deploy --all --require-approval never
```
